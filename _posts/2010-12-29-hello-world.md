title: "Hello world!"

[_All I wanted for Christmas was a blog._](https://twitter.com/#!/nicdumz/status/16359797884461056)

```python
def test():
  print "Hello, world!"
  return 42

test()
```

So here we are, a simple static blog, with a fairly simple skin derived from
the default Blogofile blog. Untested under IE: if you encounter some troubles,
feel free to submit patches to the repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/nicdumz/website).

# What should you expect?

Not much content about romance, but surely some about Sarcasm, Math and
Language! I'm mostly into Python: my first posts are likely to cover details of
Mercurial, Zope or ERP5, CPython or various other Python interpreters.
I'll categorize posts accordingly so that readers can select a topic or another.

_And who knows what might happen next?_
