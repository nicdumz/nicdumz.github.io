title: Hello world!

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nicdumz/status/16359797884461056"><em>All I wanted for Christmas was a blog.</em></a>

$$code(lang=python)
def test():
  print "Hello, world!"
  return 42

test()
$$/code

<p>So here we are, a simple static blog, with a fairly simple skin derived from
the default Blogofile blog. Untested under IE: if you encounter some troubles,
feel free to submit patches to the repository on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nicdumz/website">Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<h1>What should you expect?</h1>

<p>Not much content about romance, but surely some about Sarcasm, Math and
Language! I'm mostly into Python: my first posts are likely to cover details of
Mercurial, Zope or ERP5, CPython or various other Python interpreters.
I'll categorize posts accordingly so that readers can select a topic or another.</p>

<em>And who knows what might happen next?</em>
