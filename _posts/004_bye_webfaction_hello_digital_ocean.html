title: Webfaction was great, Digital Ocean seems better
---
<h1>Webfaction</h1>

<p>
A few years ago, <a href="https://webfaction.com">Webfaction</a> had been
offering something somewhat unique on the market. Hosting by developers, for
developers, for less than 10 USD a month.  For that price I could get SSH
access to a shared machine, deploy almost whatever I wanted and get it served
by nginx, fast. This was unique: at that time you either had to pay for pricier
dedicated machines to get SSH access, or downgrade to simple already-configured
bricks that had very little flexibility.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed the idea that I could push-over-SSH my content via my
version control system, and get it deployed via a hook.</p>

<p>Adopting Webfaction was a pretty great experience. Ticket support a few
years ago was responsive and helpful. A much better experience than what I had
hoped for.</p>

<h1>First they came for Let's Encrypt</h1>

<p>And then Let's Encrypt happened. Free SSL certificates, I thought, great!</p>

<p>You see, I'm not great at it yet, but I do care about security, and
in that respect an opportunity to participate and help spread SSL further
seemed like a great idea. I jumped in, and moved this modest website to https.</p>

<p>This is where trouble started. Webfaction has no first-party support for SSL
certificates. You're not root, they do not offer direct access
to nginx configuration files. Which means that the only way to deploy a
certificate is to bother a human via a ticket. And since Let's Encrypt
certificates expire every 90 days, it means bothering a human every ~2 months.
It's fine, support is responsive enough, but for a coder, it does give you a
bad conscience.</p>

<p>After a while (I suppose because support started receiving way too many
tickets), they implemented a way via their webadmin dashboard, to upload your
own certificates. So instead of bothering a human every 2 months, <em>I</em>
had to upload via a web form new certificates every 2 months. Not really an
improvement.</p>

<p>Webfaction always claimed that they had support coming for full Let's
Encrypt automation, but a year after the CA launch, nothing had landed.</p>

<h1>Then they came for gzip</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.breachattack.com">BREACH</a> happened.</p>

<p><b><em>tl;dr:</em></b> this is a compression side-channel attack. For HTTPS
websites that (a) do use compression, (b) include query data in the response,
<em>and</em> (c) serve some kind of secret, bad guys might be able to guess
what the secret is, by repeatedly issuing requests, with various payloads, and
observing how the compressed (encrypted) response changes.</p>

<p>It's a serious class of attack. Any website serving secrets should care and
implement counter-measures. But if you're serious about security (and you
should be, if you're serving secrets over the web, right?), I do hope that way
before the publication of this class of attacks, you were already implementing
some, if not, all, of the following countermeasures:

<ul>
    <li>Try really hard to avoid responses that do include query data, or
        responses that depend deterministically on user input. Because any
        website allowing such thing probably has way too many XSS
        vulnerabilities lurking. Hello <code>?username=alert(1);</code>.</li>
    <li>Defend against XSRF issues, using CSRF tokens. For instance, on login
        pages, it's common for servers to return a single-use random CSRF
        token/nonce that the client must submit along their request, to prevent
        repeatability.</li>
    <li>Randomize response length and content.</li>
    <li>Rate-limiting requests.</li>
</ul>

All of those basic security measures prevent repeatability, and randomize
responses, which, de facto, prevent exploiting BREACH class of attacks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Webfaction had a very different response to BREACH, possibly
because they are not security experts. Or more likely because <em>customers
that were at-least-as-ignorant-of-security asked for that specific
change</em>: <b>they disabled gzip compression for all their SSL
websites.</b></p>

<p>That's quite a pity. Sure, it's a safe, large hammer to use which
appears to immediately hide away all problems. But websites written with poor
security practices are still vulnerable websites, very likely prone to XSS or
CSRF attacks. Disabling gzip as a way to save them from BREACH is a poor
decision, not improving web security as a whole.</p>

<p>Webfaction is working on nginx config fragment support, to allow users to
e.g. enable compression per-website. But as of writing, there's no ETA for that
feature, and their support denied manual overrides to configs. No way to
re-enable gzip compression on your website.</p>

<h1>It was time to speak out?</h1>

<p>Do I really care that much about running a command and submitting a form
every 2 months to renew a certificate? Do I even need compression that bad on
this static website? No, and no. Definitely not that critical.</p>

<p>But I reached a clear, fundamental disagreement with the way this host is
running their services. I care enough about SSL to require first-party,
automated support for certificate changes. And the way to secure websites, is
to, <em>duh</em> actually fix the root cause, not disable the
<em>perceived</em> cause of a vulnerability. Sending more bytes over the wire
by disabling compression does not protect websites from basic XSS/CSRF
issues.</p>

<p>And why won't you just let me customize my nginx configuration, urgh.</p>

<h1>Digital Ocean</h1>

<p>I moved out. Looking around, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital
    Ocean</a> seemed like a great option. 5 USD a month, and in a few seconds
I could create an instance running a clean OS. SSH access, root. I get to run
whatever I want. <em>Switch gzip on, and off, and back on, as much as I
want.</em></p>

<p>In a couple of hours, on a lazy Sunday, I migrated my data from Webfaction
to Digital Ocean. Configuring nginx and auto-renewal for Let's Encrypt was
easier than Hello World in Haskell, thanks to their community-maintained guides
that even sysadmin dummies like me can follow.</p>

<p>Looking back, it's even somewhat strange. How did I survive not having full
access to the machine before?</p>

<p>Hello <b>Digital Ocean</b>, and welcome. I, for one, embrace change.</p>
