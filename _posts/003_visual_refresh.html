<p>
I've been ignoring for quite some time now warnings from Google webmaster
tools. Supposedly, they said, my site wasn't responsive or mobile-friendly.
What do you mean, people actually use smartphones?  Fine, I'll admit, previous
setup was a bit clunky, how <em>2010</em> of me.
</p>

<h1>Which framework?</h1>

<p>
It's all about <em>frameworks</em> nowadays. So here we are, then. Took the
bait.  Found a neat, minimalist CSS framework called <a
href="http://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>. It comes with a couple simple elements and
guidelines, and it was quite straightforward to adapt it to have something
working for me. Even with a Blogofile-like site doing content generation.
Result is mobile and tablet-friendly, almost free of cost.
</p>

<h1>Colors, next</h1>

<p>
I'm obviously a poor designer, and decided not to come up with my own color
scheme. Colors are from <a
    href="https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/">base16</a>, a syntax
highlighting scheme which I rely on, everyday, for all Terminal things.  This
is the <em>flat</em> variant, transposed, as I could, to something web-like.

<h1>No Disqus</h1>

<p>
Comments have also been completely disabled:
<ul>
    <li>I don't imagine or envision this place becoming a very active social
        forum, requiring that much interaction.</li>
    <li>So far comments were quite spammy, requiring some moderation, even for this tiny blog (!)</li>
    <li>More to the point though, Disqus integration added unacceptable
        extra latency, requiring at times full seconds to load. I find this
        unreasonable in 2017.</li>
</ul>
Bye Disqus!
