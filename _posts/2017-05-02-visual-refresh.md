I've been ignoring for quite some time now warnings from Google webmaster
tools. Supposedly, they said, my site wasn't responsive or mobile-friendly.
What do you mean, people actually use smartphones?  Fine, I'll admit, previous
setup was a bit clunky, how _2010_ of me.

# Which framework?

It's all about _frameworks_ nowadays. So here we are, then. Took the bait.
Found a neat, minimalist CSS framework called [Bulma](http://bulma.io/). It
comes with a couple simple elements and guidelines, and it was quite
straightforward to adapt it to have something working for me. Even with a
Blogofile-like site doing content generation. Result is mobile and
tablet-friendly, almost free of cost.

# Colors, next

I'm obviously a poor designer, and decided not to come up with my own color
scheme. Colors are from [base16](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/), a
syntax highlighting scheme which I rely on, everyday, for all Terminal things.
This is the _flat_ variant, transposed, as I could, to something web-like.

# No Disqus

Comments have also been completely disabled:

* I don't imagine or envision this place becoming a very active social forum,
  requiring that much interaction.
* So far comments were quite spammy, requiring some moderation, even for this
  tiny blog (!)
* More to the point though, Disqus integration added unacceptable extra latency,
  requiring at times full seconds to load. I find this unreasonable in
  2017.

Bye Disqus!
